Instalation guide
-----

- Download Visual Studio 2019 Professional (not sure if trial version works with auto ISS setup for project)

- Open .sln file with this

- Build with button on top of Visual Studio (on button should be "ISS" word, if there`s no -  wrong VS version, also if you get "localhost refused to connect" than it means that your VS does not support ISS feature (wrong version) )
